Girls Who Code is a nonprofit organization that is dedicated to closing the gender gap in technology and computer science. our mission is to inspire more girls to become computer scientists and engineers.

The Katy Chapter of Girls Who Code is commited to connect young girls with 
learning resources and give back to the community.

Through a series of outreach activities such as the Science Night,
Coding Workshops, etc., we have introduced many to the art of programming.
